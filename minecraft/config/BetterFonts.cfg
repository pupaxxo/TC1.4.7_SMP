# This is the BetterFonts configuration file. Any lines that start with # are
# comments and get ignored. If the same property name appears multiple times

# The font.name property changes the default font used in Minecraft. This can
# be the name of a real font like Times New Roman, or one of Java's logical
# fonts like Serif, SansSerif, or Monospaced. If font.name is missing, the
# default font used will be SansSerif.
font.name=Segoe Print
#font.name=Monospaced
#font.name=Times New Roman

# You can use the font.size property to affect how large or small the text
# will appear. This must be an integer greater than zero, and if omitted
# the default size used is 18.
font.size=20

# This property enables anti-aliasing which blurs the edges of the font to
# make it seem less jagged, but this can also make the font seem less sharp.
# The property should be set to either the word "true" or "false, and you'll
# have to experiment with both options to determine which one looks better.
# If font.antialias is missing, the default is to disable anti-aliasing.
font.antialias=true
#font.antialias=true

# By default, Minecraft draws drop shadow for any text in the GUIs and the
# chat. Setting this to "false" will disable this shadow which can make some
# fonts more readable.
font.dropshadow=true
#font.dropshadow=false
